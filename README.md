# NioShadowverseLogger
A two button match logger for Shadowverse


## What does it do?
Nio helps you keep track of your Shadowverse matches by allowing quick and easy logging. Simply press the ctrl button once on the mulligan screen and once on the results screen and Nio will write your class, your opponent's class, who went first, and who won to a log file. To exit, just hit alt (OSX) or esc (Windows).


## What can I do with this data?
If you would like to contribute your data to the public pool, simply head over to the [Team Dawnbreakers Discord server](https://discord.gg/BjeFkVS), ask one of the moderators for a "Data Logger" role, and send a message in the #data_log channel in the proper format (covered in next section). All messages sent to SAlter will be recorded and should we find that you are submitting fraudulent data or abusing the function, you will not be allowed to send anymore messages to SAlter in the future.


## Okay, so about that format?
Simply submit it like so:
+data;(copy paste of the log.txt file found in resources)

See the example below:
(pending)

Please remember to clear your log.txt file every time you do this in order to not submit duplicate data. We recommend creating a separate file for storing your old data.


## What will be done with the data?
Every week, Team Dawnbreakers will post the data on r/Shadowverse along with some analysis. If you have any other ideas or suggestions, feel free to message VLV#5047 on Discord.

# FAQ
## It's not working???
If you are experiencing technical difficulties, please inform VLV#5047. Please provide as much detail as you can about the issues that you are having. One great trick is to open the terminal/command prompt, drag the executable file into it, hit enter, and take a screenshot of the output.


## Hey, can you make it do ____?

If you have any feedback, feel free to message VLV#5047.


## Oh shoot I misclicked and hit ctrl by accident
Hitting ctrl by accident will not affect Nio.


## Oh shoot I forgot to press it on the mulligan screen
That just means that you won't be able to log this game. Sorry.


## Oh shoot this I forgot to press it on the result screen
To avoid getting erroneous data, please exit the application by hitting alt (OSX) or esc (Windows)


## Remembering to press 2 buttons per game is kind of hard, fully automatic when?
When it's fully fleshed out, that's when. (I'm actually still working on it, if I can finish it in next few days I'll make it fully automatic. If I can't, I'll change this answer to some technobabble about why it can't be done and wait for some reddit guy to prove me wrong and give me the code)


# Special thanks to...
