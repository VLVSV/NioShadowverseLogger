# NioShadowverseLogger
An AUTOMATIC match logger for Shadowverse. Just start it up before your no life ladder session and you're good to go!


## What does it do?
Nio helps you keep track of your Shadowverse matches by allowing quick and easy logging. Nio will write your class, your opponent's class, who went first, and who won to a log file. And you don't even have to do anything after you start it! To exit, just hit ctrl c on the command prompt/terminal.


## What can I do with this data?
If you would like to contribute your data to the public pool, simply head over to the [Team Dawnbreakers Discord server](https://discord.gg/BjeFkVS), ask one of the moderators for a "Data Logger" role, and send a message in the #data_log channel in the proper format (covered in next section). All messages sent to SAlter will be recorded and should we find that you are submitting fraudulent data or abusing the function, you will not be allowed to send anymore messages to SAlter in the future. You may only submit logs once a week, with the reset occurring at 3pm PST on Tuesdays. 


## Okay, so about that format?
Simply submit it like so:
+data;(copy paste of the log.txt file found in resources)

See the example below:
(pending)

Please remember to clear your log.txt file every time you do this in order to not submit duplicate data. We recommend creating a separate file for storing your old data.


## What will be done with the data?
Every week, Team Dawnbreakers will post the data on r/Shadowverse along with some analysis. If you have any other ideas or suggestions, feel free to message VLV#5047 on Discord.


## I'm in, sign me up!
Follow these links to download Nio!

[OSX](http://www.mediafire.com/file/8rus3fa2ol8j5q7/nio_mac.zip/file)

[Windows](Windows link here)

Linux: As of now, there is no Linux version of Nio. If you use Linux and are interested in helping me freeze the .py script, message VLV#5047. Do note that if a Linux version is released, I will not be able to guarantee that it contains no malicious code as whoever freezes it will be the last one with access to the .py file. So you'll have to trust them.


# FAQ
## It's not working???
If you are experiencing technical difficulties, please inform VLV#5047. Please provide as much detail as you can about the issues that you are having. One great trick is to open the terminal/command prompt, drag the executable file into it, hit enter, and take a screenshot of the output.


## Hey, can you make it do ____?
